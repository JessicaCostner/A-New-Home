Moxie
Moxie is a stunning 16 year-old Tennessee Walking Horse that came to us during a severe bout of laminitis. She is a fighter and has made it to the point where she is pasture sound. Since laminitis will be a life long struggle for her, Moxie will require a knowledgeable adopter who can manage her weight. She is a companion horse only and will never be able to be ridden because of damage that has been done to her feet. She is looking for a home where she can enjoy you and your herd!
